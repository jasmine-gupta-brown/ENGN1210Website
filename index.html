            <h2>Course Overview</h2>
            <p>ENGN 1210 is designed to introduce students to the important foundations of continuum biomechanics, properties and mechanical response of biomaterials, three-dimensional concepts of strains and stress, introduction to tensors, with principle stresses and strains and their directions using eigen analysis, linear isotropic elasticity, anisotropic behavior, yield, fracture, fatigue, nonlinear elastic, and viscoelastic response of engineering, biological, biomedical materials and structures will be taught. Students will learn each topic's physical basis, biomechanical motivation, theory, modeling, and ability to quantitatively analyze materials and structures for broad engineering and biomechanics applications</p>

            <h3>Course Outcomes Include:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1. Learn modeling methods for important loading cases, including uniaxial, shear, torsion, bending, and pressurized vessels and their applications to solve practical problems</li>
                <li>2. Learn fundamental and mathematical concepts of tensorial three-dimensional stresses and strains. Develop and apply important foundations of continuum biomechanics, including isotropic and anisotropic linear elastic modeling in 3D.</li>
                <li>3. Learn hierarchical biological and biomedical materials and structures. Understand mechanical properties, elastic and viscoelastic response, and biomechanics of soft tissues, muscles, bones, and biomedical materials.</li>
                <li>4. Learn the physical basis and models for the nonlinear and time-dependent viscoelastic response of polymers, biopolymers and biological materials.</li>
                <li>5. Learn the concepts and engineering modeling methods for critical failure mechanisms, including buckling, yield, fracture, and fatigue. Gain the ability to analyze and design structures and biomedical devices against each failure mechanism. </li>
                <li>6. Apply fundamental learnings and modeling methods from all the topics to solve practical biomedical and biomechanics problems. </li>
            </ul>
